Installing RabbitMQ
===================

Please [install a recent version of RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html)

On Debian, `RabbitMQ` is started immediately after install. To stop it, type:

    systemctl stop rabbitmq-server

First of all, let us change the default user's password. The default user is called `guest`.
To change the password, first have to start the server:

    systemctl start rabbitmq-server

and then say:

    rabbitmqctl change_password guest VGIWB0CEWwDW

where `VGIWB0CEWwDW` is the new password. Let us also remove the administrative tags from `guest`:

    rabbitmqctl set_user_tags guest    


Configuring RabbitMQ
====================

Keys and Certificates
---------------------

There is a very good guide on the [RabbitMQ website](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html), just follow the 
instructions in the section called "Keys, Certificates and CA Certificates". You do not need the
client part, **only the server part**. 

On my server, I created ``/var/rabbitmq`` and put both ``testca/`` and ``server/`` as its subdirectories, so I have
`/var/rabbitmq/testca/` and `/var/rabbitmq/server/`.

Notice that the file `/var/rabbitmq/server/cert.pem` is the __public__ certificate. (We will later import it into the
`trustStore` and send out to clients.) At the same time, `/var/rabbitmq/server/key.pem` is the __private__ key. As
it is needed at runtime, put its permissions to `640` and ownership to `root:rabbitmq`.

A nice general introduction to the `OpenSSL` Certificate Authority 
is [here](https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/).


Email the server certificate to Alice and Bob
--------------------------------------------

The folder ``server/`` contains a file `cert.pem`. Execute the following command:

    keytool -import -alias server1 -file cert.pem -keystore trustStore

You will be asked for a passphrase. Choose some passphrase and give it to Alice and Bob. You should
also send them the newly created file `trustStore`.

Enabling SSL Support in RabbitMQ
--------------------------------

This, again, is explained on the [RabbitMQ website](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html), in the section
called "Enabling SSL Support in RabbitMQ". Basically, the file `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config` should contain:

    [ 
      {ssl, [{versions, ['tlsv1.2']}]},
      {rabbit, [
         {ssl_listeners, [5671]},
         {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"/var/rabbitmq/testca/cacert.pem"},
                        {certfile,"/var/rabbitmq/server/cert.pem"},
                        {keyfile,"/var/rabbitmq/server/key.pem"},
                        {versions, ['tlsv1.2']},
                        {verify,verify_peer},  
                        {fail_if_no_peer_cert,false}]}
       ]}
    ].



Opening the port
----------------

As you have noticed, we have configured the SSL-enabled RabbitMQ to listen on Port 5671.
Obviously, we have to open that port:

    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5671 -j ACCEPT
    /etc/init.d/iptables-persistent save

Registering users
=================

To add users `alice` and `bob` and allow them to talk over the vhost ("Virtual Host") `ourtheorem` :

    rabbitmqctl add_vhost ourtheorem
    rabbitmqctl add_user alice sarrpuOSX1Nm 
    rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p ourtheorem alice '^(alice|bob)$' '^amq\.default$' '^(alice|bob)$'
    rabbitmqctl add_user bob eij3yataeJoh
    rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p ourtheorem bob '^(alice|bob)$' '^amq\.default$' '^(alice|bob)$'

where `sarrpuOSX1Nm` and `eij3yataeJoh` are their passwords. Notice that `ourtheorem` is the name of the Virtual Host,
which should match the line `<vhost>ourtheorem</vhost>` in the client configuration files `conf.xml` for both Alice
and Bob. 

Also notice that `amq.default` is the name reserved in RabbitMQ for the default exchange. 
See [the manual](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html) for details about the access control structure.

See also [the manual for rabbitmqctl](https://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html).

Web console
===========

I want one of the users to be the administrator for the purpose of Web Console
management. Let it be Alice:

    rabbitmqctl set_user_tags alice administrator

Then I want to enable the Web Console plugin:

    rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

Moreover, I want to run the Web Console under SSL. For that, I have to edit the file ``/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf``
to contain the following lines:

    [
      {ssl, (SEE ABOVE)},
      {rabbit, (SEE ABOVE)},
      {rabbitmq_management, 
            [ 
                    {http_log_dir, "/tmp/rabbit-mgmt"},
                    {listener, [
                            {port, 15671}, 
                            {ssl, true},
                            {ssl_opts, [{cacertfile,"/var/rabbitmq/testca/cacert.pem"},
                                        {certfile,"/var/rabbitmq/server/cert.pem"},
                                        {keyfile,"/var/rabbitmq/server/key.pem"}
                                       ]}
                               ]}
            ]}
    ].

Troubleshooting
===============

Log files are in ``/var/log/rabbitmq``
